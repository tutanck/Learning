# Firebase Quickstarts for Android

A collection of quickstart samples demonstrating the Firebase APIs on Android. For more information, see https://firebase.google.com.

## Samples

You can open each of the following samples as an Android Studio project, and run
them on a mobile device or a virtual device (AVD). When doing so you need to
add each sample app you wish to try to a Firebase project on the [Firebase
console](https://console.firebase.google.com). You can add multiple sample apps
to the same Firebase project. There's no need to create separate projects for
each app.

To add a sample app to a Firebase project, use the `applicationId` value specified
in the `app/build.gradle` file of the app as the Android package name. Download
the generated `google-services.json` file, and copy it to the `app/` directory of
the sample you wish to run.
